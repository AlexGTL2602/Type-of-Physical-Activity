# Type-of-Physical-Activity
We'll attempt to predict the type of physical activity (walking, climbing stairs) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data. Smartphone accelerometers are very precise, and different physical activities give rise to different patterns of acceleration. This was the final project developed in the "Using Python for Research" course.
